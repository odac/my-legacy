# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a Legacy Planning AI Assistant for Singapore. It helps users generate a legacy plan based on their personal and financial information.

## Current State

The application is a single-page web application with a form to collect user data and a section to display the generated legacy plan. The styling is basic and needs to be updated.

## Requested Change

The user wants to update the webpage to a modern, responsive design that adheres to the Standard Chartered Bank's color code and aesthetics.

## Plan

1.  **Research Standard Chartered's branding guidelines:** Find the official brand colors, typography, and design elements.
2.  **Update `style.css`:**
    *   Update colors to match Standard Chartered's palette (greens, blues).
    *   Choose a modern, clean font (e.g., from Google Fonts) that aligns with their branding.
    *   Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for a responsive layout.
    *   Restyle the header, footer, and form for a modern look.
    *   Add media queries to ensure responsiveness on different screen sizes.
3.  **Update `index.html`:**
    *   Add the Standard Chartered logo to the header.
    *   Link to any new fonts from Google Fonts.
4.  **Update `main.js`:**
    *   Ensure that all existing functionality remains intact.
    *   Add logic to dynamically display the client's name in the results section.
